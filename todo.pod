=head2 Search multiple indices

Having different Elasticsearch clusters available (or not) should
be recognized and the search results should be combined. For example,
a work cluster should be searched in addition to the local cluster, if the
work network is available.

This calls for using the asynchronous API not only for searching but also
for progressively enhancing the results page as new results become available.

From first glance, we might want Simple Expansion, but Genre Expansion
also seems interesting.

We want to treat some synonyms as identical though, like 'MMSR' and its
German translation 'Geldmarktstatistik'.
