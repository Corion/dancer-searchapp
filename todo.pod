=head2 Search multiple indices

Having different Elasticsearch clusters available (or not) should
be recognized and the search results should be combined. For example,
a work cluster should be searched in addition to the local cluster, if the
work network is available.

This calls for using the asynchronous API not only for searching but also
for progressively enhancing the results page as new results become available.

=head2 Recognizing new versions of old documents

How can we/Elasticsearch recognize similarity between two documents?

If two documents live in the same directory, the newest one should take
precedence and fold the similar documents below it.

* Don't rescan/reanalyze elements that already exist in Elasticsearch

=head3 Video data

Which module provides interesting video metadata?

=head3 Audio data

* MP3s get imported but could use a nicer body rendering.

* Playback duration should be calculated

* Also import audio lyrics - how could these be linked to their mp3s?

=head3 Playlist data

Playlists should get custom rendering (album art etc.)

=head2 Test data

* Consider importing a Wikipedia dump

* Some other larger, mixed corpus, like http://eur-lex.europa.eu/

=head2 Synonyms

Find out which one(s) we want:

L<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/synonyms-expand-or-contract.html>

From first glance, we might want Simple Expansion, but Genre Expansion
also seems interesting.

We want to treat some synonyms as identical though, like 'MMSR' and its
German translation 'Geldmarktstatistik'.
